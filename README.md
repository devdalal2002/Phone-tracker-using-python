# Phone-tracker-using-python
This code imports the necessary libraries and modules, including phonenumbers, geocoder, folium, and opencage. Phonenumbers is used to parse phone numbers. Geocoder is used to pin point the country of the phone number. The catch here is geocoder cannot pin point the current exact location of the phone due to it's limitations. Here's an insight how it works: When we input our phone number with the country code, geocoder fetches the registered country and carrier service and when we print latitude and longitude, it returns country's centre location for example if we enter a number with extension +91 (India) it returns a location in Madhya Pradesh as it is in the center of the country. We can get the location in map map using folium. If you observe the code, the map location is directly created in an html file once the code is executed.
